## Machine Learning Research Starter Kit

Hello there! I created this repository to list resources to get started with research in ML.

It's hard for people interested in conducting research in ML to publish papers, attend conferences and receive mentorship outside of PhD programs.

The resources listed here are specifically meant for people who have some familiarity or interest in Machine Learning, but do not have the financial support to pursue a PhD or visibility to work at large research labs.

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! Here are a couple of things that could serve as guidance when suggesting new resources:

1. Any and all types of resources that support research in ML are welcome.

2. Ensure that the resource you are suggesting is specifically aimed towards people just starting out with ML Research. If a resource requires extensive prior research experience/financial support, please refrain from suggesting it. This does rule out most research programs, but the idea is to be welcoming to new researchers.

3. Be kind and respectful! Please see the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it.
